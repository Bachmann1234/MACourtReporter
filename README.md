Reports on the activities of the Massachusetts General Court

This is an idea im exploring to attempt two things.

1. Learn a bit more about state and local government
2. Get some practice with Typescript

My initial idea is to attempt to track bills brought up and post them via a twitter bot account. 

I don't really have much of an agenda here. If I have any political agenda with this project its that we would all be better served to spend more of our attention focused on state and local government.
