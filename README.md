Reports on the activities of the Massachusetts General Court

This is an idea im exploring to attempt two things.

1. Learn a bit more about state and local government
2. Get some practice with Typescript

My initial idea is to attempt to track bills brought up and post them via a twitter bot account.

I don't really have much of an agenda here. If I have any political agenda with this project its that we would all be better served to spend more of our attention focused on state and local government.

# Why do you have a cert in this repo?

Turns out the MA General Court does not provide a complete certificate chain. Browsers can fill this gap for you but node does not. This cert is needed to properly authenticate the server as who they say they are (This answer explains the situation well while also providing a solution https://stackoverflow.com/a/60020493/1804512)

However, I still have a lot to learn so if you are seeing this and have tips let me know
